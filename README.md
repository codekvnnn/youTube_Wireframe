In this setup:

index.html contains the HTML structure of the page.
styles.css contains all the CSS rules for styling the page.
script.js is prepared to contain any JavaScript code necessary for interactivity.
Each file is linked in the index.html file: styles.css is linked within the <head> via a <link> tag, and script.js is linked before the closing </body> tag via a <script> tag. This is the standard way to organize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web pages.

This code provides a static layout similar to YouTube's structure. The "video-player" and "video-description" divs are placeholders and can be replaced with actual content or further designed to look more like YouTube's interface. The rectangles in the sidebar act as placeholders for menu items.
